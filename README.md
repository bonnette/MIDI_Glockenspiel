An automated Glockenspiel Arduino Project
Inspired by an Instructable

See my AutoGlockenspiel repository</br>

This is a totally different interpertation.
</br></br>
This project uses a Windows PC to drive an Arduino which fires one of 32 solenoids that sit above each note.
</br></br>
The MIDI control of the solenoids is controlled by an Arduino Pro Mini. The serial connetion between the Windows PC and the Arduino is accomplished through an FTDI interface. This interface allows music that has been converted to MIDI to be played on the Glockenspiel.
</br></br>
The Glockenspiel is a Pearl 32 note that I purchased off of Ebay for $45
</br></br>
There is only one arduino program.</br>
The current program allows only one note at a time to be played. The use of LMMS on the PC provides you with the opportunity to direct MIDI to the Arduino on one track while the other tracks play on the computer. This makes for a very pleasant experience in that, you can listen to the glockenspiel along with the accompanying instruments playing on the PC. 
</br></br>
I designed holders for the solenoids. These holders fit on the bottom rails of the glockenspiel and align the solenoids over the keys. There are five differnt holders. 
</br></br>
I used Fusion360 for the design of the solenoid holders and I thank Autodesk for allowing makers such as myself to use Fusion360 free of charge. Thanks Autodesk !
